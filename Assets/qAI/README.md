A set of tools for designing AI in a visual node editor on unity. Use for:
* Behavior Trees.
* Finite State Machines.
* Implement your own AI graphs.

### Key features
* A visual editor for Behavior Trees, Finite State Machines and the basis to create other types of AI tools.
* AI graphs implemented as reusable scriptable objects, same instance can be run by multiple GameObjects.
* Share data between the Scene an your Behavior Tree using Blackboard variables.
* Ready implemented examples to use as guidance.
* See highlighted nodes in runtime to understand how your AI graphs are running.
* Modularize your AI graphs and execute them as part of nodes of other AI graphs.
* See more in [documentation](https://github.com/jlreymendez/qAI/wiki)
